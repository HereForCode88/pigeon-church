        <h2>The Universe as Energy</h2>
        <p>At Pigeon Church, we believe that everything in existence is composed of energy. What we perceive as our universe is, in reality, energy expelled from a greater universe, much like a light particle expanding into space. This energy is still influenced by the gravitational pull of the larger universe it originated from, which is why galaxies follow a natural gravitational direction.</p>

        <h2>The Galactic Dance</h2>
        <p>This cosmic dance of galaxies is not random; it is guided by the gravitational forces of the next larger universe. Occasionally, galaxies may seem to flip their direction, only to realign in the future, continuing their journey toward the next universe. This cycle is part of the natural order, a rhythm that echoes through the cosmos.</p>

        <h2>The Sacred Knowledge of Pigeons</h2>
        <p>The ancient civilization from Cerizis, the moon-sized planet in the asteroid belt, had a profound understanding of this cosmic truth. They recognized that their world, too, was part of this grand energy exchange. To pass on this knowledge, they sent their messengers—pigeons—to Earth. These celestial beings carry with them the wisdom of the universe, sharing with us the truth of our existence and our place within the cosmic web.</p>

        <h2>Embrace the Cosmic Truth</h2>
        <p>We invite you to explore this deeper understanding of the universe with us at Pigeon Church. By embracing the cosmic truth, we can connect with the greater forces at play and align ourselves with the natural order of the universe. Let us learn from the pigeons, the sacred bearers of knowledge, and awaken to the energy that binds us all.</p>
